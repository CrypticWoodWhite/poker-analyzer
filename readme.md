Write a function in Javascript that accepts five arguments that represent five cards.
Each card will be represented by two characters.
The first character is the value of the card: 2-10, A, K, Q, and J.
The second character is the suit: h, s, d, and c.
The function should return the Poker combination the hand contains. Return values include royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair, pair, and high card.
It should return the highest-ranked combination only.
